# Generative AI Use
There has been immense progress in the last 2-3 years regarding the use of language models to assist in writing, learning, and code generation. With this assistance comes a responsibility to use it responsibly and ethically. Below are some compiled resources on how to do. The key points are to take ownership of ideas, code, and analysis generated by LLMs and double check your work by cross-referencing with other sources. Use it transparently and provide proper attribution. LLMs still exhibit phenomena such as sycophancy and hallucination, which may alter the reliability of its generated answers.

### GitHub Copilot Access
As university-affiliated researchers, we may have access to AI completion tools such as GitHub Copilot. Here are the steps to get access:
1. Visit the [GitHub documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/how-tos/manage-your-account/get-free-access-to-copilot-pro) on Copilot Pro access.
2. Click on "Apply to GitHub Education as a teacher".
3. Navigate to Education Benefits settings
4. Complete the form and submit. You may need to verify that you have an `@yale.edu` email address and provide a picture of your ID card. The application will be approved by GitHub admins.
5. TODO: @viggy fill out when approved...
