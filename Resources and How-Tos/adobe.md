We typically use Adobe Illustrator and Photoshop to make scientific figures. To get an Adobe license, you will need to submit a request for Adobe Creative Cloud to IT; see [this FAQ section](https://yale.service-now.com/it?id=kb_article&sysparm_article=KB0027311#mcetoc_1j3r5inrc22m).
- Licenses run within a fixed period, from August to August, regardless of when you register for one.
- Students at the Yale School of Medicine receive Adobe CC for free, and students from other departments should request it through their school directly.
- Other staff (like postdocs, postgrads, technicians, etc.) at YSM can request an upgrade using [this form](https://forms.office.com/pages/responsepage.aspx?id=u76M3Tkh-E20EU4-h6vrXO9v2moL5KBGqNzstb4YeNZURTU0UkpNUDdWWFJTMEwyOUdJM1MzWTFTUi4u&route=shorturl). The $15/year charge listed will be covered by the department.
- For non YSM-staff, Yale provides the license to staff via [Software Library](https://yale.onthehub.com/WebStore/Welcome.aspx).
- IT will want you to provide justification for the upgrade; explaining that you need Illustrator/Photoshop to edit scientific figures for posters or publications should be sufficient.
