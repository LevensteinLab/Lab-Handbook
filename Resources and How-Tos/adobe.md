We typically use Adobe Illustrator and Photoshop to make figures, though some people prefer open-source freeware like Inkscape and GIMP.

To get an Adobe license, you will need to submit a request for Adobe Creative Cloud to IT; see [this FAQ section](https://yale.service-now.com/it?id=kb_article&sysparm_article=KB0027311#mcetoc_1j3r5inrc22m)\*.
- Licenses run within a fixed period, from August to August, regardless of when you register for one.
- Students at the Yale School of Medicine receive Adobe CC for free, and students from other departments should request it through their school directly.
- Other staff (like postdocs, postgrads, technicians, etc.) at YSM are entitled to a deep discount on the license at $15/year (see [email from FAQs](https://view.message.yale.edu/?qs=3fe5a5ad99b5850c6fe741d03ccf84c4edd5c6ec0c7c762a52a9f64ecf555b3ad319e2dd39ca68445f60105dfc001aec47efb6a66aab282bf8d3674ceff8c1fb17c8335e7db531c7dc3763046b6088fc)), and can request an upgrade using [this form](https://forms.office.com/pages/responsepage.aspx?id=u76M3Tkh-E20EU4-h6vrXO9v2moL5KBGqNzstb4YeNZURTU0UkpNUDdWWFJTMEwyOUdJM1MzWTFTUi4u&route=shorturl). They will want you to provide justification for the upgrade; explaining that you need Illustrator/Photoshop to edit scientific figures for posters or publications should be sufficient.
- For non YSM-staff, Yale provides the license to staff at $41.24/year via [Software Library](https://yale.onthehub.com/WebStore/Welcome.aspx).
