TBD

TODO (Dan): Specify schedule for periodic meetings (e.g. once a week 1-on-1, once every 3 months steering meeting....)

### Journal Club

format: everyone read the paper, and we're each assigned a figure or two to walk us through. this way we avoid the trap of one person reading/presenting the paper and no one else. The idea is that we all read the paper, and you come ready to walk us through your figure (no slides needed), answer questions people have about the figure, and ask questions of the group re: things that you didnâ€™t understand. If there are supplemental figures/methods associated with your figure you should be familiar with those too.

### Booking Rooms

It's possible to book the conference rooms on our floor for meetings. This is done through [Robin](https://dashboard.robinpowered.com/yale-university/schedule/user). All you need to do is sign in with your Yale Account. There are two ways to book rooms. 
1. On the Schedule tab:
    1. You can see upcoming public meetings and your meetings on the `My Meetings` tab.
    2. Book rooms by looking at the schedule format (like a Gantt chart), and hovering over the room and time you want. 
2. On the Office tab:
    1. You can see a layout of the floor, as well as what rooms are available.
    2. Book rooms by clicking on a room and viewing available times.
3. Input required details and submit.
