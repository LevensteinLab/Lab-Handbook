### Booking Rooms

It's possible to book the conference rooms on our floor for meetings. This is done through [Robin](https://dashboard.robinpowered.com/yale-university/schedule/user). All you need to do is sign in with your Yale Account. There are two ways to book rooms. 
1. On the Schedule tab:
    1. You can see upcoming public meetings and your meetings on the `My Meetings` tab.
    2. Book rooms by looking at the schedule format (like a Gantt chart), and hovering over the room and time you want. 
2. On the Office tab:
    1. You can see a layout of the floor, as well as what rooms are available.
    2. Book rooms by clicking on a room and viewing available times.
