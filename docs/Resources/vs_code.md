To get started with VS try a tutorial, such as [this one](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/getting-started). The program itself will also give you some tips.

Some basic tips to get started:
1. Link VS Code with your GitHub account
2. Open a repository, such as `Lab-Handbook`
3. Try out the terminal (e.g. try `echo $SHELL` to see which shell your computer runs by default)
4. Install the Python extension
5. Create an environment
6. Use the debugger. You can copy `Resources/debug_me.py` to a new repo to try it out! You can create a lab repo that you will also use for the pRNN tutorial. Just make sure that you don't try to push it to this repo.
