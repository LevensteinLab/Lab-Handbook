To book travel and accommodation for conferences, use World Travel/Concur, Yale's platform for business travel. See [here](https://your.yale.edu/work-yale/campus-services/yale-travel-management) for more information. You can log into the Concur website [here](https://concur.yale.edu/).

There is a training in Workday called ["Booking Federally Sponsored Travel with World Travel"](https://www.myworkday.com/yale/learning/course/1e7e093ab7a21001abc67bad56c90001?type=9882927d138b100019b928e75843018d&record=00f9b09f318e102c62781e428a3d0001) that you should complete in order to understand the restrictions on booking travel when using federal funds.

You have a few options when it comes to airports:
- Bradley International Airport (BDL) in Hartford, CT: drive/Uber
- Newark International Airport (EWR) in Newark, NJ: direct Amtrak train from New Haven
- John F. Kennedy Airport (JFK) in Queens, NYC: Amtrak to LIRR or E train to AirTrain
- LaGuardia Airport (LGA) in Queens, NYC: Metro-North to Harlem-125th Street, then Uber or M60+ bus

The three NYC airports (including EWR) are generally far cheaper and better connected. The direct Amtrak train from New Haven to Newark/EWR makes that the most convenient option. You can book Amtrak tickets in [Concur](https://concur.yale.edu/) (you should book them in advance) or use the [TrainTime App](https://www.mta.info/traintime) to buy Metro-North/LIRR tickets (less important to buy in advance).

To navigate the MTA (NYC's public transit system) use Google Maps or e.g. CityMapper for real-time arrival info. The MTA has tap-to-pay terminals, so you can purchase ticket on-site using your card or phone.
