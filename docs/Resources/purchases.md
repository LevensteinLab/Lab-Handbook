# Making Purchases


Generally, either Dan or Viggy will handle purchases for the lab. In this past, this included the shared coat rack, monitors for new members, cables, etc. Purchases/Requisitions are done through [Workday](https://www.myworkday.com/yale/d/home.html). You can check the catalogue of items by opening Workday and searching "Create Requisition". If you click OK to accept the default fields, you will see an option to "Connect to Supplier Website". There, you can choose from a list of suppliers, or search for products directly. Once you find the item you're looking for, confirm it with Dan, then send the supplier and product information to Viggy. If you'd like to make purchases yourself, you may need to take a few Workday Learning courses. 

If you have any boxes to dispose of, please leave them by the trash can in front of Dan's office, rather than in the main WTI lounge. This was particularly requested by the custodial staff.
