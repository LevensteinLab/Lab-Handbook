*This page delineates the onboarding processes. Please try to follow it step by step. If/when you find steps that are out of date, that are poorly described, or that you think should be added to the process, please update the Lab Handbook. You should have made at least one change by the time you complete onboarding (if you don’t know how to do that, you’ll learn!), and please follow this practice whenever using the lab handbook.*

**Your first day (or before, if possible)**

- Familiarize yourself with Lab policies, practices, and expectations. You don’t need to read the whole thing, but do read over the expectations for your position in the lab and [Working hours, remote working, and vacation](https://www.notion.so/Working-hours-remote-working-and-vacation-2650350ea7a680e69cf6c1e591d1a87f?pvs=21)

    - Your first PR: Update the lab handbook to improve something that was unclear or missing up until now.
- Join [Mailing lists/groups at Yale](https://www.notion.so/Mailing-lists-groups-at-Yale-2620350ea7a680a1a329e025a8dad6ba?pvs=21)

**First readings (first week)**:

Discuss with Dan your interests and potential first projects. In addition to any reading he suggests, take a look at [Recommended Reading](https://www.notion.so/Recommended-Reading-2620350ea7a680f1bc87fded38009158?pvs=21). If you’re new to working with neural networks, or to neuroAI, I highly recommend these as places to start:

- https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-019-0520-2
- https://www.nature.com/articles/s41583-023-00705-w

**Getting started (1-2 weeks)**:

- Read about the [Lab Code and Software Practices](https://www.notion.so/Lab-Code-and-Software-Practices-2840350ea7a6800a8b1cd1d3e4ed05b3?pvs=21), and the introduction of the good research code handbook (https://goodresearch.dev/index.html). We don’t follow this religiously, but it’s a good place to start. Something to remember: the main outputs of your work in the lab will be *ideas*, *figures*, and *code*. Of those, your code
    - If you don't have a preferred IDE, Get VS Code and do VS code tutorial
- Your first project: PyTorch Tutorials (https://docs.pytorch.org/tutorials/, https://docs.pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/deep_learning_60min_blitz.html)
    - Set up a project repository for the tutorial
    - By the end of this, you should have trained a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) to solve fMNIST
    - Next, modify the network in some way you find interesting.
- Using the compute cluster tutorial
- Your second project: pRNN Tutorials
    - By the end of this, you should have trained a basic predictive RNN in a gridworld environment, and analyzed its spatial tuning properties
    - Next, modify or use the network in some way you find interesting. This could involve a new environment or behavioral policy, or changes to the network architecture, loss, or learning rule. Feel free to discuss some ideas with Dan.
